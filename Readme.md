### Cargo facts

Use `cargo new <name>` to create new project with cargo. It will create project with a git repository already initialized for you. But it won't create repository if you run it from existing repo. You can switch VCS using `-vcs=` flag with `cargo new`.
Use `cargo build` to build the program.
Use `cargo run` to build and run the program.
Use `cargo build --release` for production build.
